    **ABOUT**
</p>

<p style="font-family: accanthis; font-size:13pt; color:white; text-align: justify">
I am a Costa Rican biologist interested in the ecology, evolution, and conservation of bats. I enjoy using phylogenetic data to explore evolution and relationships between ecological and morphological traits in bats. Additionally, I like to use spatial and environmental data to bring a geographic perspective to my research; and add relevant components to conservation, seeking to influence the conservation and protection of bats and the ecosystems they inhabit.

Currently, I am a master's student of Biology at Towson University in Maryland (since fall 2023). I am a member of the [***Caetano Lab***](https://caetanods.weebly.com/). My project focuses on the evolution of diet in frugivorous bats from the family Phyllostomidae, including its diversification and influence on speciation events.

During my free time, I enjoy cycling, running, and painting. I also love to go hiking in the mountains and coffee plantations close to my home. I have a dog named Ema, and I enjoy taking her for hiking or short walks at night.
