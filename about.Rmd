    **ABOUT**
</p>

<p style="font-family: accanthis; font-size:13pt; color:white; text-align: center">
I am a Costa Rican biologist interested in bat ecology, evolution, and conservation. I enjoy using phylogenetic data to explore the evolution and relationships between ecological and morphological traits in bats. Additionally, I am interested in employing spatial and environmental data to gain a geographic perspective on bat ecology and their evolutionary history. Finally, as part of my research I like to add conservation-relevant components looking for the results to have implications for the conservation and protection of bats and the ecosystems they inhabit.

Currently, I am a master's student of Biology at Towson University in Maryland. I am a member of the [***Caetano Lab***](https://caetanods.weebly.com/). My project focuses on the evolution of diet in frugivorous bats from the family Phyllostomidae, including its diversification and influence on speciation events.
